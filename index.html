                <h2>Egg benedicted</h2>
                <p>Eggs are a very good source of inexpensive, high-quality protein. More than half the protein of an
                    egg is found in the egg white, which also includes vitamin B2 and lower amounts of fat than the
                    yolk. Eggs are rich sources of selenium, vitamin D, B6, B12 and minerals such as zinc, iron and
                    copper.

                <h2>salad with chola</h2>
                <p>Chickpeas help control blood sugar. Canned and dried chickpeas have a low glycemic index. This means
                    your body absorbs and digests them slowly. Also, they have a type of starch that digests slowly,
                    called amylose. Both of these things help keep your blood sugar and insulin from going up too fast.
                    This is good for people with diabetes.
